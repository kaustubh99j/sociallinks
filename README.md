## My process
Initially, I blundered and applied the  position property to position the elements in CSS but it was not a feasible option. So, I revisited my approach and used the flex property to properly arrange items in CSS. 

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned to write clean and maintainable code, instead of focusing solely on the outcome and end result.
